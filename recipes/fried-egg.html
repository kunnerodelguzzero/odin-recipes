    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried egg, we're in love. Once you master the crispy, 
        olive-oil-fried egg, you're going to want to put one 
        on everything you make. And you should. Here are our 
        favorite ways to use them, from egg-topped grain bowls 
        and hash to messy-but-worth-it sandwiches.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>   
        <li>3 tablespoons olive olive</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper, freshly ground</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet 
            (a 10" skillet is perfect for 2 eggs) over medium-high.</li>
        <li> When oil is shimmering, carefully add eggs one at a time, 
            shaking pan gently after each addition.</li>   
        <li>Cook eggs, shaking pan occasionally to keep them from sticking to each other (a rubber spatula can help nudge them apart if needed), 
            until edges are golden brown, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully tilt skillet toward you so that oil pools at front edge of pan.</li>
        <li>Spoon hot oil over egg whites, especially anywhere they are still translucent, while avoiding yolks, until whites are set, about 1 minute more. </li>
        <li>Transfer to a paper towelâ€“lined plate to blot oil; season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
